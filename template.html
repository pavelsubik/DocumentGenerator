      <div class="property__title">PROVENANCE</div>
      <div class="property__text">A gift from William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor (1848-1919) to his son Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor (1879–1952) and his wife, Nancy Astor,
who inherited the family estate at Cliveden, in Buckinghamshire</div>
      <div class="property__text">This superb mirror, almost certainly after a design by the 18th-century cabinet makers, Ince & Mayhew, was formerly in the collection at Cliveden
House, a 19th-century Italianate mansion in Buckinghamshire. The model
is closely related to two designs in the firm’s Universal System of Household
Furniture, plates LXXXV and LXXXV. It was probably acquired by the New
York born Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor (1879-1952) and his wife, Nancy
Astor, also of American descent, who inherited the family estate at Cliveden
as an extravagant wedding gift from his father, William Waldorf Astor, 1st
Viscount Astor. The 1st Viscount had purchased Cliveden from Hugh Lupus
Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster in 1893, but it was under the direction
of his daughter-in-law Nancy that the mansion underwent significant
restoration and re-decoration. In this period the mansion was acclaimed and
revered for fine and exquisite entertaining, known as ‘the Golden Period’,
amongst the wealthy and fashionable elite.
This glittering couple was actively involved in British politics for most of
their lives. Lady Astor, with the influence of her husband, became the first
female politician in Parliament, taking her seat on 1 December 1919 as a
Conservative member, serving the Sutton division in Plymouth, until her
retirement in 1945. During her period of office she championed numerous
causes, such as State Health Care and Town Planning, votes for women at
twenty-one and various other issues that advocated equality between men
and women. The connection between Cliveden, politics and entertainment
continued to grow. The famous comedienne Joyce Grenfell, who became
such a hit in New York, was a frequent visitor, and was Nancy Astor’s niece.
Winston Churchill was a guest during the earlier days of entertaining and
party to many a heated political debate with Nancy. On one known visit to
nearby Blenheim, Lady Astor was prompted to say, ‘Winston, if I were your
wife I’d put poison in your coffee’ to which Winston responded, ‘Nancy if I
were your husband I’d drink it’. Other prominent visitors included the artist
John Singer Sargent, who painted portraits of several family members (see
his portrait of Nancy illustrated here), and George Bernard Shaw, with whom Lady Astor enjoyed a close friendship and correspondence, and was once
addressed by him as ‘Dearest Fancy Nancy’. During the 1960s the house
became linked with the infamous ‘Profumo Affair’, where John Profumo, the
Secretary of State for War met the call girl Christine Keeler at a party hosted
by Lord Astor in July 1961. It was this scandalous affair coupled with her illicit
liaison with a soviet naval attaché that outraged parliament and in 1963,
as the Cold War began to challenge Britain’s political system, it led to his
resignation from office.</div>
      <div class="property__title">CONDITION REPORT</div>
      <div class="property__text">There are the inevitable minor dents marks and scratches and shrinkage cracks due to age and use.
Overall an attractive and imposing mirror in good `country house condition'.
the catalogue illustration is acurate.
There is slight general wear to the gilding revealing a reddish coloured bole
beneath, general surface cracking to the gilding. Minor chips and repairs to
the carved decoration.
One of the leafy branches of the cresting may be replaced.
As noted the large central plate replaced and ditto some of the border plates,
these can be identified by a slightly yellow colour and different foxing to the
silvering. The backboards replaced.
Structurally secure.
The fascination for the far East and specifically the popularity of Chinese
'nodding head' figures, which were imported by the East India Companies
and served as ornaments for mantelpieces and general decoration, was
increased circa 1800 by the dissemination of the Chinese style evident in the
redecoration of Carlton House, London and Brighton Pavilion for George,
Prince of Wales, later George IV</div>
